# Architecture Overview

OctoLLM is designed as a distributed AI system with hierarchical processing.

## System Layers

1. **Ingress Layer** - API Gateway + Reflex preprocessing
2. **Orchestration Layer** - The Brain (strategic planning)
3. **Execution Layer** - The Arms (specialized modules)
4. **Persistence Layer** - Distributed memory stores
5. **Observability Layer** - Metrics, logs, tracing

For detailed architecture documentation, see the [ref-docs/OctoLLM-Architecture-Implementation.md](https://github.com/doublegate/OctoLLM/blob/main/ref-docs/OctoLLM-Architecture-Implementation.md) in the repository.
